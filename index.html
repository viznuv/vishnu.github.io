                <p><b>Overview:</b> Focuses on when and how brands take social or political stances—and the trust, backlash, or loyalty that follows. Combines experimental work with causal modeling and large-scale data analysis.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Trust Formation in Brand Activism:</b> Manipulate cause relevance, hedonic framing, and message believability to see how they affect brand trust and purchase intent.

                    <li><b>Financial Impact of Platform Strategies:</b> Perform event-study and panel regressions to measure stock price and revenue reactions to punitive vs. engagement policies on sharing platforms. Theorize under a Social Exchange × Reactance-Control framework to link platform tactics with financial outcomes.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="research-block">
                <h3>3. Social Media Dynamics & Polarization</h3>
                <p><b>Overview:</b> Unpacks the socio-technical processes by which platforms drive echo chambers, credibility judgments, and engagement patterns. Emphasizes both qualitative frameworks and quantitative pipelines.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Social Media-Induced Polarization (SMIP):</b> Conduct integrative reviews categorizing algorithmic filtering, affective polarization outcomes, and potential remedial cross-ideological cues. Design experiments that pair headline tone with celebrity endorsement cues to test dissonance effects.</li>
                    <li><b>Content Credibility & Community Trust:</b> Apply NLP topic modeling and sentiment-trajectory analysis to Twitter Community Notes to map credibility signals over time. Build echo-chamber detection pipelines using network clustering and Bayesian inference to identify polarized clusters.</li>
                    <li><b>Moderation, Gatekeeping & Engagement:</b> Develop a socio-technical framework combining Social Identity Complexity, affordance theory, and moral economy for hypothesis generation. Quantitatively analyze how shifts in moderation policies reshape user participation and discourse diversity.</li>

            <h2>Vision</h2>
            <p>To rigorously address complex marketing and societal challenges by harnessing emerging technologies—bridging theory, empirical analysis, and real-world impact.</p>
            <h3>Theoretical & Methodological Rationale</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Interdisciplinary Synthesis:</b> Integrate insights from marketing theory (e.g., attention economics, social exchange) with computational methods (e.g., machine learning, agent-based simulation) to generate testable hypotheses about consumer and social behavior.</li>
                <li><b>Data-Driven Inquiry:</b> Employ a full spectrum of data sources—from controlled experiments and surveys to large-scale digital trace data—applying advanced analytics (ML classification, causal inference, network analysis) to triangulate evidence and strengthen internal and external validity.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Role in Executive Education & Consulting</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Executive Education:</b> Curriculum Innovation: Design and deliver modular programs that embed hands-on AI labs, live case studies on digital platform strategy, and simulation exercises in Bayesian decision-making. Leadership Development: Coach senior managers to interpret AI-derived insights, translate predictive analytics into marketing strategy, and foster data-driven cultures within business units.</li>
                <li><b>Consulting Engagements:</b> Strategic Diagnostics: Leverage proprietary ML models and econometric tools to audit clients' marketing mix, identify inefficiencies, and recommend optimization roadmaps grounded in Bayesian MMM and multi-touch attribution. Change Management: Guide organizations through the operational adoption of data platforms (e.g., Apache NiFi, Dataiku), ensuring seamless integration of analytical pipelines with legacy systems and stakeholder alignment.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Exploring Newer Frontiers</h3>
