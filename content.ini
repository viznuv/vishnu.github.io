Cause‑Related Marketing & Consumer Ethics

Data Analytics & Experimental Methods

Research Programme Overview

A comprehensive empirical research portfolio employing rigorous experimental and computational methodologies to advance marketing theory and practice.

Marketing Technologies & AI‑Driven Consumer Insights

AI Recommendation Systems

Compared personalised, collaborative‑filter, and generic engines; multilevel mixed‑effects and causal estimators captured individual heterogeneity.

Generative AI for Personalisation

Built real‑time fine‑tuning workflows aligning LLMs with shopper intent, enabling adaptive offers without privacy compromise.

Bayesian Marketing‑Mix & Attribution

Developed PyMC‑based models reconstructing media decay, saturation & interaction effects; Shapley‑inspired pipelines reallocate conversion credit.

Virtual Consumption & Compulsive Buying

Survey × behavioural‑trace triangulation shows platform cues, FOMO, reinforcement sensitivity spur burst spending; SEM reveals impulsivity & perceived scarcity as mediators.

Metaverse Service Perception

Warmth × competence drive engagement & WOM in immersive retail/service; experiments outline design levers for virtual brand experiences.

Brand Activism & Consumer Ethics

Trust Formation & Backlash Dynamics

Brand‑cause‑consumer balance framework: congruence & message believability strengthen trust; misalignment triggers reactance.

Expectation Violation & Recovery

Lab, field & event studies examine how timing, valence & attribution of activism missteps unravel brand trust; recovery strategies mitigate fallout.

Platform Governance & Autonomy

Punitive tactics (e.g., credential crackdowns) erode perceived autonomy; engagement‑oriented nudges restore cooperation.

Ethical Digital Behaviour

Explores password sharing, data transparency & pro‑environmental purchasing; clarifies how fairness perceptions and self‑determination shape ethical compliance online.

Digital Communication & Societal Dynamics

Credibility & Community Fact‑Checking

Bipartisan wording & source diversity enhance perceived helpfulness of community notes; sentiment‑trajectory mapping traces diffusion of credibility cues.

Echo Chambers & Gatekeeping

Network clustering & Bayesian label propagation detect emergent ideological clusters; moderation policy design influences discourse diversity.

Human–LLM Opinion Dynamics

Extended dialogues reduce lexical entropy yet widen belief distance on contentious topics; suggests conceptual separation via subtle reinforcement.

Attention Bias in Conversational Advertising

Token‑level attention analysis shows mid‑answer brand‑keyword placement boosts recall & persuasive intent.
